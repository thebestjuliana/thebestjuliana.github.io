            I grew up in Denver and I love to explore. This passion lead me to the slopes teaching people with disabilities to ski, to a ranch in Wyoming, to a non-profit teaching financial literacy to students through hands on learning experiences, to a tech startup with their billing department, and ultimately to the life of a developer. 
            Suscinctly, the experiences show my journey as creative looking for innovative, effective, and efficient solutions in everything I do. 
            In my free time I love to hang with my dogs, explore the outdoors, cooking, and trying all the deliscious foods.
