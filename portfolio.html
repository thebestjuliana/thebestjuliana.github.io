            <h4> <a href="https://github.com/thebestjuliana/Group3_Midterm.git">Krusty Krab </a> </h4>
            This was a group project, created with 3 of my classmates. We affectionately referred to the program as the Krusty Krab as a working title that ultimately stuck. 
            It is a console app that replicates a the Krusty Krab dining experience. This customer interface allows customers to view the menu, add/remove/edit from their cart, and pay
            via cash, check, or credit card. 
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/thebestjuliana/CapstoneWeek2_TaskList">Task App</a></h4>
            An app built to manage tasks! The user utilizes the app to track tasks to complete. The user is able to create tasks, assign them to users with a description and due date. Once created you can view tasks by date or by assigned to. Once completed tasks can be marked as complete and deleted (or just deleted cuz some tasks are perpetually on your to do list.)
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/thebestjuliana/BlockbusterLab">Blockbuster </a></h4>
            This project simulates the nostaligia of the "blockbuster"experience. Through the console, users can purvey a library of DVDs and VHS mmovies. 
            The user can watch the movie with scene selection capabilities for DVDs and even the rewind experience for VHS tape (you know you missed that).

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/thebestjuliana/CapstoneWeek1_PigLatinTranslator">PigLatin Translator </a></h4>
            This interface allows people to enter a phrase into the console and have the phrase returned to them in pig latin. 
            It retains the users casing convention (first letter of word or sentence) if applicable and punctuation. Shows heavy use of string methods.
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/thebestjuliana/BudgetCalculator">Budget Calculator</a></h4>
            Front-End project taking inputs of income and expenses to return if you are over or under budget!
